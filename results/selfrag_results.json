The GIT diseases considered here can be grouped into three groups based on symptomology: 1) production of diarrhea: AAD, CDD, ID, TD, 2) the destruction or inflammation of tissues in the stomach, large intestine, ileal reservoir, or bowel: NEC, Pouch, and HPP, 3) abdominal pain, flatulence, and irregular bowel movements: IBS.",
      "Previous studies have shown probiotic efficacy in treating inflammation-related, diarrhea-related, and IBS symptoms",

In diarrhea-related diseases, probiotics may induce a general immune response, in addition to increasing IgA antibodies against rotavirus [32], [33]. In inflammatory-related disease, probiotics are thought to decrease disease activity and promote remission [34]. Reductions in inflammation are thought to occur by decreasing pathogenic bacterial growth through the enhancement of barrier functions which prevents the invasion of tight junctions, by lowering gut pH, and by stimulating non-specific and specific immune responses [",

The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics.",
      "Current evidence indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific, they do not act through the same mechanisms, and nor are all probiotics indicated for the same health conditions. However, they do share several common features in that they exert anti-inflammatory effects, they employ different strategies to antagonize competing microorganisms, and they induce cytoprotective changes in the host either through enhancement of barrier function, or through the upregulation of cytoprotective host proteins.",

      "It is now recognized that miRNA also have a primary role in cancer onset and progression. Oncomir is the term used to describe an miRNA involved in cancer. Such miRNAs were initially linked to tumorigenesis due to their proximity to chromosomal breakpoints (Calin et al., 2004b) and their dysregulated expression levels in many malignancies (Calin et al., 2004a). Abnormal gene expression by miRNAs has been correlated with several types of tumors, and such genes may function as oncogenes or tumor-suppressing genes (Figure 2).",
      "In humans, 50% of the miRNA genes are located at genomic sites associated with cancer-specific chromosomal rearrangements.",
      "The strongest evidence for an association between miRNAs and cancer was demonstrated by a sequence of three concurrent studies published in Nature in June 2005 (He et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2005; O\u2019Donnell et al., 2005).",
      "Several classes of deregulated miRNAs have also been shown to be differentially expressed in breast cancer, compared with healthy breast tissue (Volinia et al., 2006). Moreover, the expression signatures of informative miRNA subsets have enabled better molecular classification than mRNA expression profiles in several types of human cancer (Lu et al., 2005).Among the miRNAs differentially expressed in breast cancer, miR-10b, miR-125, miR-145, miR-21 and miR-155 have consistently presented the highest degree of deregulation. Downregulation of miR-10b, miR-125b and miR-145 and upregulation of miR-21 and miR-155 suggest that these miRNAs may play an important role as tumor-suppressors or oncogenes (Blenkiron et al., 2007).",

An NGS based mutation screening procedure allowing the detection of inherited Alu insertions within any predefined sequence was used for the case of c.1739_1740insAlu in BRCA1 and c.156_157insAlu in BRCA2. Another NGS study screened BRCA1 and BRCA2 resulting in  overall sensitivity for SOLiD and PGM of 97.8% (95% CI = 94.7 to 100.0) and 98.9% (95% CI = 96.8 to 100.0) respectively.

Genes known to cause deafness were sequenced by the Illumina NGS platform. Results demonstrated that targeted exons captured by our approach achieved specificity, multiplexicity, uniformity, and depth of coverage suitable for accurate sequencing applications by the NGS systems. Reliable genotype calls for various homozygous and heterozygous mutations were achieved.

FACTUAL ACCURACY: The initial answer correctly identifies the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 as scales with acceptable psychometric properties for screening poststroke depression. However, it fails to mention the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS) which was specifically designed for assessing depression after stroke, as evidenced in Document 1.\n\n2. COMPLETENESS: The initial answer addresses the question by listing three depression rating scales with acceptable psychometric properties for screening poststroke depression. However, it could be more comprehensive by including the PSDRS as another relevant scale based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. GROUNDING: The initial answer references specific evidence from PubMed articles to support the claim that the HDRS, CESD, and PHQ-9 have acceptable psychometric properties for screening poststroke depression. This grounding in scientific literature strengthens the credibility of the answer.\n\n4. HALLUCINATIONS: The initial answer does not include any unsupported claims. However, it could be improved by incorporating the evidence related to the PSDRS to provide a more comprehensive and accurate response.\n\nOverall, the initial answer is mostly accurate and grounded in evidence but lacks completeness by omitting the PSDRS as a relevant scale for screening poststroke depression.

Other approaches included the construction of special empirical rules using amino-acid propensities and prior knowledge of the structural nature of the proteins, and the development of Neural Network-based predictors to predict the location of alpha-carbon atoms with respect to the membrane.

A few methods/tools and computational pipelines for the detection of gene fusion events have been introduced. The basic steps followed in these approaches consist of (i) all-against-all sequence comparison, (ii) detection of non-overlapping similarities of two genes/proteins (components) to a single gene/protein (composite), and optionally (iii) elimination of putative spurious hits (e.g. due to promiscuous domains) achieves via clustering based on sequence similarity and examining dense regions of the resulting graph or by querying the PFAM database. An advantage of gene fusion analysis is that functional associations can be predicted even in cases of genes of unknown function. Due to the computationally intense nature of these approaches, precompiled data of this type are often organized in specialized databases. Tools and databases developed for this purpose include (in alphabetical order): fdfBLAST, FusionDB, InPrePPI, (Integrated method for Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions), MosaicFinder, Phydbac2, PLEX, Predictome, Rosetta Stone method, STRING.",

      "we refer to the fused gene as a 'composite' protein, while the un-fused counterpart genes in the reference organism are referred to as 'component' proteins [1,3].The accuracy of this approach has previously been demonstrated [3,9], however the presence of so-called 'promiscuous domains' in eukaryotic species has made it problematic to apply this method across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. These widespread domains (e.g. WD40 or TPR) are present in a multitude of combinations in many eukaryotic proteins [10] and can confound gene-fusion detection by appearing to be multiple conserved examples of gene-fusion components [3]. For this reason, we have improved our detection method to filter highly promiscuous domains from predictions.Previously, we used sequence homology and clustering to attempt resolving this issue, however this approach is computationally intensive. For this analysis, we take a simpler approach based on the PFAM domain database [11]. By delineating the domain architecture of each protein involved in a fusion event, we are able to locate and filter those domains that appear to link an inordinate number of proteins together based on domain interaction graph connectivity analysis",
      "Sequence similarities for all proteins against each other was generated using NCBI BLASTp v2.0 [29] with an E-value threshold of E \u2264 1e-10. Two proteins will be considered as interacting partners of a gene fusion event if both were similar to a non-overlapping part of a third sequence and were not similar to each other. To check similarity between the interacting proteins, we used a Smith-Waterman dynamic programming alignment tool [30,31] (prss33) with a threshold p-value of 0.04.Promiscuous Domain FilteringWe calculated the domain architecture of all protein sequences using HMMER [32] against the PFAM (v15) database [11] as a reference, using an e-value threshold of E \u2264 1e-10. A frequency analysis was then performed on the connectivity of PFAM domains. Recently, an analysis similar in spirit but different in detail has also been published [33]. The distribution obtained is logarithmic, with a long tail. We assume that this tail indicates the presence of promiscuous domains. When these data are visualized as a network, using the BioLayout tool [34], most of the nodes (i.e. proteins) are connected (i.e. interacting) in a super-cluster, due to the presence of promiscuous domains.

      "While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships.",
      "Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations.",
      "Functional associations of proteins in entire genomes by means of exhaustive detection of gene fusions",
      "These powerful methods rely on the observation that pairs of genes encoding proteins of known function (usually interacting or forming a complex) tend to be found in other species as a fused gene encoding a single multifunctional protein [4]. This type of event is known as gene fusion and is a well-known process in molecular evolution",
      "the detection of gene fusions in one genome (defined as 'composite' proteins) allows the prediction of functional associations between homologous genes that remain separate in another genome (defined as 'component' proteins).Although gene fusion events appear to be relatively rare, the accurate detection of a gene fusion event in one genome allows interactions to be predicted between many proteins in other genomes",
      "The exhaustive detection of gene fusion events in entire genome sequences allows the prediction of functionally associated components based merely on genome structure. The all-against-all species comparison is a necessary step because we have repeatedly observed fused, composite proteins in taxonomically lower organisms.",
      "All 24 genomes were filtered using the CAST compositional bias filtering algorithm [20], then compared against themselves and each of the other 23 genomes using the BLASTp [21] sequence similarity searching algorithm with a cut-off E-value of 1 \u00d7 10-10. The DifFuse algorithm [1] was then applied automatically to each genome in turn as a query against the other 23 (reference) genomes.",
      "Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events",
      "Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison.",
      "Gene fusions have been suggested to be useful characters for identifying evolutionary relationships because they constitute synapomorphies or cladistic characters. To investigate the fidelity of gene-fusion characters, we developed an approach for identifying differentially distributed gene fusions among whole-genome datasets: fdfBLAST.",
      "Genome-scale comparative analysis of gene fusions, gene fissions",
      "Based on these comparisons, we developed a new method to integrate the features used in all four methods. We named the method InPrePPI (an Integrated method for Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions). InPrePPI first calculates a score for each protein-protein pair predicted by each method, then optimally weighs the score, and finally obtains an integrated score. Based on the integrated score, InPrePPI extracts the PPIs with high confidence from all of the predicted protein pairs. Our comparison of InPrePPI with the joint observation method and STRING indicates that InPrePPI in general outperforms the others. Finally, we implemented the four genomic context based methods and InPrePPI in a user-friendly platform-independent system.",
      "Genomic context information has been frequently used in the computational methods for PPI prediction. There are four major genomic context based methods: the phylogenetic profile method [14], the gene cluster method [3], the gene fusion method [15], and the gene neighbor method",
      "In this study, we first evaluated the prediction performance of the four major genomic context based methods (PPM, GCM, GFM, and GNM), then we developed a novel integrated method (InPrePPI) based on the comparisons of these four methods in three datasets (KEGG, EcoCyc, and DIP).",
      "In the gene fusion method, two or more proteins were identified to be functionally linked when they were not encoded by neighboring genes in E. coli but were uniquely homologous to a single protein in a reference organism",
      "Here we present Predictome, a database of predicted links between the proteins of 44 genomes based on the implementation of three computational methods--chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic profiling and domain fusion",
      "Pairs of genes that function together in a pathway or cellular system can sometimes be found fused together in another organism as a Rosetta Stone protein--a fusion protein whose separate domains are homologous to the two functionally-related proteins.",
      "Using the Rosetta Stone method and this scoring scheme, we find all significant functional linkages for proteins of E. coli, P. horikshii and S. cerevisiae, and measure the extent of the resulting protein networks.",
      "We considered the four most important mechanisms of modular rearrangements\u2014fusion, fission, terminal deletion, and domain addition (Bj\u00f6rklund et al. 2005; Pasek et al. 2006; Weiner et al. 2006; Buljan et al. 2010). The algorithm assigns a fusion event when two ancestral arrangements can be fused to form the gained arrangement.",
      "This fusion analysis (also known as \"Rosetta stone\" method) takes advantage of the study of genomic structures and sequence similarity to detect putative interacting protein pairs, which, importantly might not have been suspected based on current biochemical knowledge. Briefly, if a pair of non-homologous proteins which are found in different genomic regions in organism A, are found fused into a single ORF in organism B, this suggests that the two independent proteins in organism A may interact.",
      "We used a home-built software tool [42] based on the BLASTp search algorithm [43] to identify gene fusion links (Figure 6). The output of the program consists of pairs of non-homologous T. brucei proteins, which appear fusion-linked in other species, i.e. when queried against the proteome of another organism, both match the same protein as their best BLAST hit.",
      "The top scoring hits were verified by various criteria, such as the top scoring hit on the reverse BLAST process, the E-value threshold, the similarity and functionality of domain architecture between the component and composite proteins.",
      "The software algorithm was developed to exclude any homologues which are 85% identical over the whole sequence length. Hence, a protein with a similarity value of 85% or higher to a larger protein of the sameorganism, was deleted from the proteome.",
      "A fusion-linked protein was taken into consideration only if each component had a minimum DOMAIN length of 70 amino acids, along with a minimum of 27% identity with the composite protein, based on the BLAST alignment per domain.\u2022 We automatically excluded all results with an E-value higher than the threshold of 10-3, as not statistically significant.\u2022 Two proteins were considered to be fusion-linked only if each of them aligned with a minimum PROTEIN coverage of 70% to the same reference sequence (based on the protein annotation of the target organism).",
      "Fusion events between proteomes have been used to predict protein-protein interactions [12],[13] with some degree of success, in particular metabolic enzymes for which stable protein-protein interactions in one species could be advantageously substituted by the products of fusion events in other species."

      "The data indicate that micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus.

For this purpose, gene fusion events may be used as the sole evidence or as independent information combined with other 'genome-aware' or similarity-based methods, and functional association may be predicted at different levels.

Briefly, if a pair of non-homologous proteins which are found in different genomic regions in organism A, are found fused into a single ORF in organism B, this suggests that the two independent proteins in organism A may interact. These protein-protein interactions may be transient or more long-lived, either within a metabolic pathway, or as part of a multi-subunit protein complex.",

Using the GNF Human GeneAtlas, this study found that nine out of the ten tissues that express genes most significantly associated with ultraconserved noncoding elements constitute various members of the central nervous system.10.1371/journal.pone.0020088.g007Figure 7TF-encoding genes predominantly expressed in the central nervous system are enriched with CNEs.",

This strategy has been effectively used to identify a large number of putative enhancers conserved in distantly related vertebrates such as mammals and teleost fishes [26], [27], [28], [29]. Functional assay of such elements in transgenic mouse and zebrafish have indeed indicated that a large number of them function as transcriptional enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of reporter genes during embryonic development [26], [28], [29]. We have aligned sequences of the Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes and predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the locus.

      "Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis.",
      "Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results.",
      "Primary factors correlating with fusion rates are the presence of transmembrane helices in HKs and the presence of DNA-binding domains in RRs, features that require correct (and separate) spatial location. In the absence of such features, there is a relative abundance of fused genes.",
      "We show that indels are the most frequent elementary events and that they occur in most cases at either the N- or C-terminus of the proteins. As revealed by the genomic neighbourhood/context of the corresponding genes, we show that a substantial number of these terminal indels are the consequence of gene fusions/fissions. We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins.",
      "We found that fusion events are approximately four times more common than fission events, and we established that, in most cases, any particular fusion or fission event only occurred once during the course of evolution.",
      "Analyzing the most parsimonious pathways, we find 87% of architectures to gain complexity over time through simple changes, among which fusion events account for 5.6 times as many architectures as fission.",
      "Our aim is to understand the evolutionary dynamics by studying the frequency of individual modular events such as fusion, fission, or terminal loss.",
      "We considered the four most important mechanisms of modular rearrangements\u2014fusion, fission, terminal deletion, and domain addition",
      "Fusion events makeup the largest proportion of exact solutions, followed by domain addition, fission, and terminal deletion. Fusion events occur with a frequency of 4.59/Myr, followed by fission with 1.98/Myr, and gain with 1.89/Myr.",
      "Recent rearrangements can mostly be explained by the fusion of two single or two domain proteins. The relative rates of fusion and fission are similar to previously reported rates (Kummerfeld and Teichmann 2005).",
      "The high retention rate of proteins that result from a fusion event might be explained by the conservation of at least one regulatory element in the upstream region, whereas after fission, one arising protein may lose a regulatory region and undergo pseudogenization followed by gene loss.",
      "Quantitative analyses have shown that fusions are more prevalent to fission (Snel et al. 2000)",
      "Lastly, for merge and split events, a comparison of their counts revealed a 0.86:1 merge-to-split ratio, which at first seemed inconsistent with previous studies suggesting that fusion occurs more often than fission by a factor of 2.6\u20135.6 (Snel et al. 2000, Kummerfeld and Teichmann 2005, Fong et al. 2007). However, one key difference in this analysis is that we measured individual events, as opposed to simply observing the presence of fused and fragmented extant genes, and we measured events over a smaller higher resolution time scale (the 62 My Drosophila clade vs. all three domains of life diverging over 3.5 billion years).",
      "by considering only \u201csimple\u201d merges and splits that are unaccompanied by generation, duplication, or loss events, the merge-to-split ratio became 5.28:1, which is much more comparable to previously determine ratios.",
      "For example, gene fissions are relatively rare events compared to fusions [11]",
      "These trees defined timelines of architectural discovery and revealed remarkable evolutionary patterns, including the explosive appearance of domain combinations during the rise of organismal lineages, the dominance of domain fusion processes throughout evolution, and the late appearance of a new class of multifunctional modules in Eukarya by fission of domain combinations",
      "We searched for examples which have arisen by one of the three postulated mechanisms: independent fusion/fission, \"duplication/deletion,\" and plasmid-mediated \"cut and paste.\" We conclude that all three mechanisms can be observed, with the independent fusion/fission being the most frequent."

      "Considering that DMN has been shown to be involved in self-referential processing [12, 14-16, 20-22], these results suggest that the strength of EEG DMN operational synchrony could be a potential indicator of a patient\u2019s expression of self-consciousness.",

When we investigated exon-level expression of the genes, there were no differences between parental strains. However, exon 4 of ZEB1 had much lower expression compared to all other exons of this gene, indicating alternative splicing (Figure 6A). Interestingly, ZEB1 produces two splice variants, Zfhep1 (NP_037296.1, ENSRNOT00000046013) and Zfhep2 (ZEB1, ENSRNOT00000024336), for which exon 4 (NP_037296.1 exon 1) is specific for the Zfhep1 variant (Figure 6B). The resulting protein differs in the first zinc finger cluster (Figure 6C). This prompted us to investigate if splice-variant specific differences of ZEB1 could be involved in regulation of EAE"

Moreover, retrovirus-mediated restoration of SPARC expression in KLF4-transfected cells abrogated KLF4-induced anti-invasion activity. Together, our results indicate that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell invasion by suppressing SPARC gene expression.",
      "To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation",

SPARC RNA and protein levels were also low or undetectable in AML cell lines with MLL translocations. Consistent with its tumor suppressive effects in various solid tumor models, exogenous SPARC protein selectively reduced the growth of cell lines with MLL rearrangements by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase.",

Similar growth repression by SPARC has been reported for ovarian cancer cells, and this may be a common feature among carcinomas.",

The evidence from Document 1 directly supports the claim of 25 selenoproteins in the human selenoproteome.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The initial answer does not address the fact that selenoproteins may not be present in all organisms, as evidenced by Document 2 and Document 3.\n2. The evidence from Document 2 and Document 3 suggests that selenoproteins may not be present in certain insect genomes, which raises questions about the universality of the claim that the human genome encodes 25 selenoproteins.\n3. The initial answer does not acknowledge the potential variability in selenoprotein content across different species, which could impact the accuracy of the claim for humans specifically.\n\nOverall, while the initial answer provides a specific number supported by evidence, it lacks completeness in addressing the potential variability and absence of selenoproteins in other organisms, which could impact the accuracy of the claim for the human genome.",
